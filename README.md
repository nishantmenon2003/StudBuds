(one sentence per bullet, maximum 4 bullets):**

* Map Feature

## Testing Notes

Here are the mockups. Login/Register Pages. Homepage to browse study session listings. A post Study Session form for creating and a profile page to edit and delete listings. We used screenshots of the login/register page since we sent in our updated mockups a bit later so we had this done by then.
